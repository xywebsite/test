					<p>Introduction to Web Development, Html, Css.</p>
<p> Today, I learnt about the basics of Web Development, Html, Css.</p>
<p> I learnt about the importance of documenting work and listing down what I learnt every week.<br>
	We were then introduced to pure text editors, such as Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.<br>
	Personally, I prefer Sublime Text as I’m more familiar with it. <br>
The advantage it had over other text editors is that it is Open Source, and Free to use.<br>
It also has unlimited text length and it is cross platform. </p>
<p>Introducing HTML, the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a Web page , and HTML consists of a series of elements, a start and end tag.<br>
Each element contains content. Elements tell the browser how to display the content, HTML defines the content.</p>

<p>I was then tasked to make a simple sample website using HTML.<br>
Firstly, I created a folder “mywebsite” then I created a file “index.html” within the folder.<br>
Then I edited and entered the contents of a basic web-page, headings, paragraphs, lists and added pictures.<br>
Then I saved my file and displayed it on the browser to check if it came out right.</p>

<p>I also learnt about CSS, which is used for beautifying and presenting layout information.<br>
 I then watched the Jake Wright - “Learn CSS in 12 minutes” video on YouTube.<br>
 It shows the creation of a site content, and it shows how an effective layout can be planned.<br>
Jake Wright uses id (e.g. #container, #navigation) to define his rules for his page.</p>
<p><h2>Here is an example of the Jake Wright Website I did.<h2></p>
      <table>
        <td><div class="image"><img src="images/Jake.png" width="800px" alt="My Image" class="center"></div></td> 
    </table>
    <p><h2>Here is an example of the Jake Wright Website I edited to my liking.<h2></p>
        <td><div class="image"><img src="images/Jake Edit.png" width="1300px" alt="My Image" class="center"></div></td>
				</ul>
