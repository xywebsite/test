					<p>Introduction to Fablab Safety and Tools.</p>
<p> Today, I learnt about the safety rules in Fablab.</p>
<p> To operate the Fablab machines, I have to be trained and I should know how to operate it properly to prevent accidents, and to prevent the machine from malfunctioning due to misuse. I was also taught what to do when emergencies and accidents happen in the Fablab. I was also told about the appropriate attire for entering the Fablab. Students were to wear short sleeved shirts and to keep their hands free of adornments. No loose items like loose hanging necklaces were allowed in the Fablab too. I was also taught good housekeeping practices in the Fablab, such as clearing debris and chips off the workstation after use, and bringing the leftover materials to the recycling area. </p>
<p>In order to enter the Fablab, I had to take the Fablab Safety quiz to ensure that I remembered the rules and how to prepare to enter the lab appropriately. To pass the quiz, I had to get 90/100 points. </p>
